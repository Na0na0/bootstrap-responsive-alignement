# bootstrap-responsive-alignement

A Sass extension for bootstrap to implement responsive alignement.
This is my first attempt at writing actual sass code, I know it's ugly but I'll try to maintain the code and make it an actual extension.

## Installation

I have no clue how most package managers (npm, bower, ...) works, so for now I'd advise to simply `git clone` into your path assets.
